In this data cleaning and preprocessing project, we focus on the widely-used Medical Appointment No Shows dataset. We thoroughly clean the dataset by identifying and resolving missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formats, and incorrect data types — preparing it for further exploratory data analysis and modeling.
